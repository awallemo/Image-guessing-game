# Image-guessing-game
A two player image guessing game where there is a proposer and a guesser. The proposer will have a segmented picture available and then choose one segment each round. The guesser on the other hand cannot see the picture, he can only see the segments that are shown by the proposer each round. When the guesser has seen enough segments and can make up a decision on what is on the picture he will write in the guess. There is also a singleplayer mode where the computer is the proposer and the player plating the game is the guesser.  The intent was to implement what was learned in the course "DAT240 - Videreg√•ende programmering", and to possibly develop a machine learning algorithm for the game. This can be used to figure out how little information is required to identify what an object is. The single player mode will therefore learn from which key parts of images work best for a human to identify an object.
